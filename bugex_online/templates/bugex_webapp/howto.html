  					<h3>Storing and presentation of your data</h3>

						facts as produced by BugEx that highlight different   important aspects of the failure.  You can 
						click  on a single fact in the list of facts. The system  then will display  the code that  is 
						associated with the fact, marking those lines to which the fact refers, and display the textual 
						content of the fact.  You  can filter the facts according to their type. Then the results get 
						visually  filtered by the system to only display the facts associated with the types chosen by
						you.  Some  variable, method or class  may  not  be  defined  in the scope of the given source 
						code. This issue occurs if one or more necessary  source code files  are missing from the 
						uploaded archive, or if the variable, method or class belongs to third party code.</p>
