    ======================================================================
    There are alternatives for including the basic Bootstrap CSS file above.

    1) The extra responsive version:
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}css/bootstrap-responsive-2.0.4.css">

    2) The LESS versions (either normal or extra responsive version):
    <link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}less/bootstrap.less">
    OR
    <link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}less/bootstrap-responsive.less">

    If you include the LESS versions as in 2), you have to import the
    LESS JavaScript file as well:
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}js/less-1.3.0.min.js"></script>

    If you change a setting in a LESS file, you can then just reload the page
    and the changes are recompiled on-the-fly by the LESS JavaScript file.
    CAUTION: This does not work out-of-the-box in Chrome browser due to
             some security features related to JavaScript.
             Take a different browser for testing or look here for a workaround:
             http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3084892/less-js-not-working-in-chrome

    Alternatively, you can compile the LESS files yourself and only include
    the compiled CSS file.

    Including LESS files is suitable for development only (compilation too slow),
    CSS files are thus recommended for deployment.
